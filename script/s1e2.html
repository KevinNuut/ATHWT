<strong><em>INTERIOR WELLINGTON MANSION KITCHEN</em></strong><br />
<br />
<em>The BUTLER, who is a man that is pretending to be a robot, stands near the stove. He has boxes over his head, chest, arms and legs to give him his lame robot appearance.<br />
<br />
MR. WELLINGTON, who acts like JR from Dallas, but looks like an upstanding English gentleman complete with large bushy mustache, stands in front of him pummelling the holy hell out of him.<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington's punches accent each of his lines.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
I swear, the next time you set burnt toast down in front of me, I'm gonna go back in time to before you were born, crawl up into your mother's uterus, and make her unable to bear children.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
And you know I can do it, right?<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
But it wasn't toast, it was a grapefruit.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington stops punching him.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Same difference.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington resumes wailing on him.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
One thing I can't stand to see is a grown man making excuses. Own up to your toast burning ways.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington stops punching him.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Get out of here, before I get my time machine.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
<em>The Butler stops.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington punches him once more.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
OK, now go.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Thank you, sir.<br />
<br />
<em>The Butler exits.</em><br />
<br />
<em>From another doorway, GINGER enters. Ginger is Mr. Wellington's trophy wife. She's ideal for this position, or any position for that matter, as her breasts are the size of bowling balls. Extremely large bowling balls.<br />
<br />
Ginger stares at Mr. Wellington.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Can't let 'em get comfortable. Gotta keep 'em on their toes.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
When is Julie getting here?<br />
<br />
<em>The sound of SHATTERING GLASS erupts from another room.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
What the-<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington runs from the kitchen toward the sound of the shattering glass, with Ginger in tow.</em><br />

<br />
<em><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;" id="a:qr254"> Two robots, CHARLES and SAM, stand in the front room. </span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS;" id="a:qr255">Charles, Sam's father, is a puny robot with thin arms and</span> legs, and a digital face. He is dressed as if he is a security guard. Sam, on the other hand, is a large, threatening robot. He resembles the bad robot from Robocop.<br />
<br />
Charles and Sam are throwing bricks through any piece of glass they can.<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington rushes into the room, standing at the top of the steps.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
What in tarnation is going on in here?<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington sees Charles.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Oh, it's you.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Do we have to do this everyday?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Do you have to ask me that everyday?<br />
<br />
<em>Charles throws a brick through a window.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Stop it.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
No.<br />
<br />
<em>He breaks another one.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Now I mean it.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles breaks another one.</em><br />
<strong><br />
CHARLES</strong><br />
Alright, that was the last one.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles does it again.</em><br />
<strong><br />
CHARLES (CONT'D)</strong><br />
That one. That was the last one.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles breaks another one.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES (CONT'D)</strong><br />
For real this time.<br />
<br />
<em>He breaks another.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES (CONT'D)</strong><br />
OK, that one was an accident.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
No it wasn't.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
No, really it was.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles breaks another window.</em><br />
<strong><br />
CHARLES</strong><br />
Now that one was on purpose.<br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Are you done?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Almost.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles breaks two more windows.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Alright. I'm done. I don't have anymore bricks.<br />
<br />
<em>Sam breaks a window.</em><br />
<strong><br />
CHARLES (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Sam still has some though.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington explodes in rage.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
That really is too much. I'm tired of this, Charles. This crap is getting old.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Then give us what we want.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
It'll be a cold day in hell when you get a dime out of me.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
That reminds me, can I get some change? I need to feed the meter.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington comes down the stairs.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Oh sure. I hate those freaking things. Here you go-<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Wait! No! Get the hell out of here or I'm calling the cops.<br />
<strong><br />
CHARLES</strong><br />
Fine. We'll go, but you know and I know that the Father wanted us to have all of this after he passed on.<br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
MY father hated you. He always regretted inventing your kind.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
That's a lie. The Father loved us as his own.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
<em>(sarcastically)</em><br />
Yeah. He loved you like a <br />
<br />
<em>Charles starts crying.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Well you know what? I lied. I'm not out of bricks.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles breaks another window and runs out of the house, crying like a baby. Sam is left standing there. He breaks another window and follows his Dad.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington sighs.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Butler! Clean this up.<br />
<br />
<em>The Butler runs in and starts cleaning up the glass.<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington sighs again and punches him.</em><br />
