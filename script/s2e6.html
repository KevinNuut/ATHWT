<br />
<em>Johnny stand guard by the door facing away from Julie and Rafe.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
<em> (whispering)</em> <br />
We have to get out of here. <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
Why? I like it here. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Shhh. <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns around and looks at them. Rafe looks around whistling. Johnny turns back around.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE <em>(CONT’D)</em></strong> <br />
<em> (whispering)</em> <br />
Keep it down. These people are crazy. Do you know what they’ll do to us if we stay here? <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
All I know is they better make sure that my bed sheets are entirely made of Bulgarian Helmeted Musk Ox fur. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
They’re going to kill us. <br />
<br />
Johnny turns around again and looks at them. Rafe looks around again whistling. Johnny turns back around. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE <em>(CONT’D)</em></strong> <br />
<em> (whispering)</em> <br />
They’re going to kill us.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
<br />
Why would anyone want to kill someone as beautiful and moisturized as me? Besides,they’re far more likely to kill you first because I’m the one with all the money. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
What?! <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turn around again and looks at them. Rafe looks around again whistling.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
You know some people aren’t able to whistle. <br />
<br />
Johnny sobs a little. Julie takes two steps towards Johnny. <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
There, there. <br />
<em> (to Rafe)</em> <br />
And why are you whistling the first place. You know he’s sensitive about this. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Who’s side are you on? <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Insensitive jerk. <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns back around sobbing slightly.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
<em> (to Julie, whispering)</em> <br />
Hey, I’m trying to get us out of here. <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
I don’t know why I’d want to escape with you if you’re just going to go around hurting people’s feelings. <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe sighs.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Here’s the plan. Since the idiot over there seems to like you, we need to use that to our advantage. I need you use all your feminine wiles to seduce him. <br />
<br />
<strong><em>DREAM SEQUENCE</em></strong> <br />
<em>Julie walks toward Johnny. Johnny turns to face her and looks down at her body.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
While he’s busy with you, I’ll sneak up behind him and knock him out. <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe pops up and knocks out Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />

<br />
<strong> RAFE (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
With Johnny taken care of, we can create a makeshift compass using&nbsp; this electronic gizmo on my chest and one of Johnny’s buckles. And float it on the puddle of urine, that will be, by then, steadily streaming from his now unburdened bladder. <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
That’s disgusting. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Using the compass we will be able to determine which way is east? <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE</strong> <br />
Why east? <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Having studied the area prior to my trip here, I learned that the majority of the houses were built during the Cold War era. As everyone feared a nuclear attack from the west, their houses were built facing the opposite direction. Hence…<br />
<br />
<em>Julie stares at Rafe.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
The front door should be due east. <br />
<br />
<em>Julie stares at Rafe.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (O.C)</strong> <br />
Wow! <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe turns to look at Johnny, who has been staring at them the whole time.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
With a plan like that, I don’t stand a chance. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Sooo, does that mean we can go? <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Yeah, you better because if I pee on this floor again, Roberto will be really mad. <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe and Julie look at each other and run out of the room and up the first set of stairs. They suddenly stop and look up the next flight of stairs.</em> <br />
<br />
<em>Nina, Roberto and Sam stand at the top of the stairs.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> NINA</strong> <br />
No. No. No. If you leave now, you’ll miss out on all the fun I had planned for you me and Sam.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina racks a shotgun.</em>
