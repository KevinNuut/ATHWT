<em><strong>INTERIOR BUNKER LOCKER ROOM</strong></em><br />
<em>Wellington and Butler enter the locker room. Wellington fidgets as he looks around the room.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Look at this place. Can you believe someone lives here? <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
I don’t know. I am fond of the metal décor. <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington punches.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Decor? What I tell you about reading my Ladies Home Journal before I finish doing the word search? <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
Actually sir, it was your Homes and Gardens. <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington punches him again.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Even worse. <br />
<em> (beat)</em> <br />
Look at that mess over there. With all this robot filth around I’m at risk to catch some kind of avian tetanus syphilis. <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
Sir I don’t think that’s possible. <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Don’t talk to me what with all your <br />
immunities. <br />
<br />
<em>Sniffing sounds are heard.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
What was that? <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
I didn’t hear anything. <br />
<br />
<em>Sniffing sound again.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Shhh. There it was again. <br />
<em> (beat)</em> <br />
Maybe it’s those dreaded Hardy Boys. <br />
<br />
<em>Nancy jumps out from behind the lockers.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> NANCY</strong> <br />
Not the Hardy Boys. <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington screams. Butler screams. Nancy screams. Wellington again with Butler. Nancy again with Butler. Butler continues to scream pauses and continues screaming.</em> <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington punches Butler and he stops screaming.</em> <br />
<br />
<em>Charles runs in.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
What’s the matter? <br />
<br />
<em>Charles sees Wellington.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Oh no, did I miss my 2:30 brick throwing appointment? <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
As usual Charles, I don’t have time for your crap. It has come to my attention that you have allowed Chavez to operate out of your… ahem… home. <br />
<br />
<strong> NANCY</strong> <br />
Let’s say it was the result of a mixture of long weekends in Tijuana and an elementary school book fair. How was I supposed to know kids have smaller body cavities that normal people and almost no understanding of free trade agreements. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Honey, you don’t need to explain anything to this man. <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Well somebody, I don’t care who, better tell me there’s a drug farm upstairs! <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
If someone had decided to give us the money we’re owed from the Father’s will, we wouldn’t have to rent out the upstairs. <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
I can’t believe you would have the audacity to rent to that Chavez scum. Do you have any idea what drugs are doing to my town. <br />
<br />
<em>Charles looks at Nancy.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Let me tell you the story about a young man who started off taking money out of his mom’s pocket book to get an extra candy bar. Eighteen years later he’s turning tricks in order to lick the backs of rats that lived old meth barrels. <br />
<em> (beat)</em> <br />
And do you know who that young man was? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Who? <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
You. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
No it wasn’t. <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
It wasn’t? <br />
<em> (to Butler)</em> <br />
Who am I thinking of? <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
Frank Zappato. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
I think I played cards with him once? <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
No you didn’t. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Don’t tell me who I don’t play cards with! <br />
<br />
<strong> BUTLER</strong> <br />
I made him up. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
So you’re a traitor and a liar! <br />
<br />
<strong> WELLINGTON</strong> <br />
Enough. The point is this is my town and I want them out of here now! <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Well this is MY home and I can rent to anyone I want. <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington screams in anger and punches Butler twice.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Now if you don’t mind I need to gather up my bricks for our meeting later. <br />
<br />
<em>Wellington screams again, punches Butler, and runs out. Butler follows.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
You know, Nancy. That was the first time I’ve ever been able to get under that man’s skin. And to think, all it took was your little…mix up. <br />
<br />
<strong> NANCY</strong> <br />
And drugs. Lots of drugs. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Yes dear. And drugs. Lots of drugs.
