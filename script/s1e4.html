<strong>INTERIOR ABANDONED COLD WAR BUNKER</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Sam and Charles stand in the main room of their dingy abandoned cold war bunker home.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
And he's the main reason I can't wear snow pants anymore.<br />
<br />
<em>Sam's heard this several times before.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
I know, Dad.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
You can't trust a Wellington or they'll screw you. Screw you right to the wall. Now-<br />
<br />
<em>The largest robot of the family, CINDY, runs into the main room, crying. She is bulky, white, and Daddy's little girl.<br />
<br />
Sam and Charles turn to look at her.<br />
<br />
Cindy keeps sobbing until she sees Sam and Charles staring at her.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Don't look at me!<br />
<br />
<em>Charles slowly walks over to her.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
What's the matter, honey?<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy sobs between words.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Connie told everyone at school that I'm the fattest girl in town.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy breaks into another crying fit.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Awww...honey. Come on now. You're not fat.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
And technically, you don't have the reproductive organs to classify you as a girl.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy sniffles a little.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
You're just saying that because you're my Dad.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Come on sweetie, you know the Father designed you in his own image. <br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
You mean he wheezes when he climbs the stairs too.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Don't start, Sam. Cindy, you're perfect in my eyes.<br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
Perfectly ass-heavy.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy starts crying again.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Sam!<br />
<em>(to Cindy)</em><br />
He didn't mean it, honey. <br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
Yes, I did.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles turns to Sam and pulls out a bat.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
One more time and you taste the pine.<br />
<br />
<em>He puts the bat away and turns back to Cindy.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES (CONT'D)</strong><br />
The truth is the Father made all of us with things we don't like about ourselves.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
I mean just look at these arms. They're pitiful and T-Rex like.<br />
<br />
<em>They all look over at a T-Rex standing by a wall. The T-Rex drops his head in shame and walks out of the room. They all turn back to their converstation.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
But why?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Well, if you liked everything about yourself, then what would you obsess over day in and day out?<br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
Whether or not you can use spray cheese as toothpaste.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy starts crying again.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Don't listen to him. He's just upset because he was an accident.<br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy snickers and sniffles.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
I never really thought about it that way.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Sure.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
You know when your mother was about your age she had a similar thing happen to her.<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Really? Mom?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Yep. Why don't you go ask her about it?<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Okay. Thanks, Dad.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy walks out of the room.</em><br />
<strong><br />
CINDY (O.C.)</strong><br />
Mom!<br />
<br />
<strong>SAM</strong><br />
What do you mean I was a mistake?<br />
<br />
<em>Charles turns to Sam.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Had to keep flapping those gums, didn't you? Now you get to see the finish on this bad boy up close and personal.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles pulls out the baseball bat again.<br />
<br />
Cindy walks through the halls of the bunker.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Mom!<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy turns a corner to see her mother, NANCY, standing in the corner.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Hey, Mom. Dad said that when you were my age, other girls would pick on you. How did you deal with it?<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy begins sniffing like a cocaine fiend.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Drugs. Lots of drugs.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Drugs are the only way to make all the voices stop.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
You want some?<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
God, yes!<br />
