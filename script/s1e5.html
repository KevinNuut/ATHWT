<em><strong>INTERIOR WELLINGTON MANSION FRONT ROOM</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Julie walks into the front room. She stands at the bottom of the grand staircase.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Daddy! We're here!<br />
<br />
<em>Her calls echo off the cavernous mansion.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington, enters the front room from atop the staircase. He is accompanied by Ginger. </em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Jules!<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Daddy!<br />
<br />
<em>Julie runs up the stairs and kisses her father on the cheek.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Step back, let me take a look at you.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie backs up.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
You look more and more like your mother every day.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
You think?<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Until that wheat thrasher incident. I swear she looked like a chicken that caught in a tractor's nuts.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Daddy, Rafe's waiting outside.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Hmmm. Is he now? Then you better go bring him in here so we can meet the fella asking for my daughter's hand in marriage. <br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington turns to Ginger.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
What do you think, porkchop thighs?<br />
<br />
<em>Ginger nods.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Julie squeals in delight, runs back down the stairs, and out the door.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
God, I wish she'd stop bringing every loser that proposes to her over here.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie reenters.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Daddy, this is Rafe.<br />
<br />
<em>From behind Julie, Rafe steps out and stands next to her.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington and Ginger descend the stairs.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
So you're Rafe, huh? We've been hearing a lot about you?<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
All good I hope.<br />
<br />
<em>All four of them start laughing. The laughter slowly peters out.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
You're my kind of...man...squid...thing.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
What do you say we all retire to the dining room and cut into some big, thick steaks I had flown in from Texas.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Actually, Mr. Wellington, I'm a vegan.<br />
<br />
<em>Dramatic soap opera music cue hits hard.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington gasps. Julie gasps. Ginger tilts her head back, but no noise comes out. Rafe gasps.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Wait.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
<em>(to Julie)</em><br />
How dare you have the nerve to bring this...this hippy into my house.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
But Daddy, I love him.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Don't you "but Daddy" me. You expected me to give you my blessing and welcome this freak into our family. Well missy, you've got another thing coming.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Actually, a vegan lifestyle helps clean-<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
That's enough out of you mister green jeans.<br />
<em>(to Julie)</em><br />
Any other guy I would have been fine with. A commie. A meth head. An eight-five year old pervert. But this is-<br />
<br />
<em>The BUTLER enters the room.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Sir, you have a phone call.<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington storms out of the room, muttering, leaving Ginger with Julie and Rafe.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Taiwanese flesh peddler. Anything.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie stands with her back to Rafe.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
I don't think your Dad likes me.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie starts to cry.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
I can't, Rafe. Don't make me do it.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Huh? Do what?<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
You're asking me to pick between you and Daddy.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
No, I'm-<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
That's unfair of you, Rafe. You don't understand him.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
No, really I was just saying that-<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Do you think that I can stopping loving my Daddy?<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Julie-<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Cause it's not like a switch that I can turn on and off.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Julie!<br />
<br />
<em>Julie turns around. Rafe punches her in the face.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Let's run away, Rafe. Heck with what Daddy thinks. Let's get married.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie runs out of the room. Rafe sighs heavily and goes after her.</em><br />
<em><strong><br />
EXTERIOR WELLINGTON MANSION</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Julie and Rafe round a corner of the house. Suddenly, Roberto and Johnny are standing in front of them.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Surprise.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto pistol whips Rafe. Everything goes black. Another pistol whip is heard and Julie hits the ground with a thud.</em><br />
<strong><br />
ROBERTO (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Grab him and come on.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Okay.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Hey, you're not allowed to touch her there. The bathing suit area is off limits. I'm telling Mo-<br />
<br />
<em>Another pistol whip is heard and Johnny hits the ground with a thud. <br />
<br />
Roberto sighs.</em><br />

Mr. Wellington enters the room.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Well this day just keeps getting better and better. I just-<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington looks around, noticing the absence of Julie and Rafe.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Where'd they go?<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington looks at Ginger. Ginger stares blankly at him.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Well?<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington huffs.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
I'm going downtown. Seems Chavez's assistant was spotted near the bunkers. I need to make sure she knows who runs this town.<br />
<br />
<em>Dramatic soap opera music cue hits hard.<br />
<br />
Ginger turns and walks up the stairs.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Yeah.<br />
<em>(calling after her)</em><br />
It's me, by the way. In case you were wondering. It's me.<br />
