<em>Nancy stands alone in a dead end. Her back is turned and she is SNORTING.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Nina stands in a connecting hallway watching her.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Tsk. Tsk. Tsk.<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy gasps and spins around. She is nervous and fidgety. </em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Ni- Nina?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Where's our money?<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy laughs nervously.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
It's funny that you should ask that. Because I had it last week and I...uh...went out of town. I...uh...went on a hunting expedition up North.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Really?<br />
<br />
<em><strong>FLASHBACK - SNOWY LANDSCAPE</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Nancy takes aim on a large lion that runs through the snow upright.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY (V.O.)</strong><br />
Yeah, yeah. I was hunting the...uh...rare bipedal lion.<br />
<br />
<em>The lion stops running and looks into camera.</em><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>NINA </strong><br />
That's funny because, one, them bipedal lion has only been found in Dayton, Ohio and, two, it's been extinct since 1947.<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
I didn't say bipedal lion.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Yes, you did.<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
No, see what I said was-<br />
<br />
<em><strong>FLASHBACK - SNOWY LANDSCAPE</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>The lion is still staring into camera. It jump cuts to a gingerbread man. Then gingerbread man breaks off the camera stare and starts running.</em><br />
<strong><br />
NANCY (V.O.)</strong><br />
The elusive Saskatchewan Gingerbread man.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA (V.O.)</strong><br />
It sounded like bipedal lion to me.<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy takes aim on it's head and fires. The gingerbread man drops dead.</em><br />
<strong><br />
NANCY (V.O.)</strong><br />
I can see where you could make that mistake.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Now, I had just snagged me a five gum dropper when the... uh... Hardy Boys rolled up.<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy stands over her kill as a jeep rolls up with two occupants. </em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA (V.O.)</strong><br />
Hardy Boys?<br />
<br />
<em>A giant sock puppet and a tribal priest jump out of the jeep.  The sock puppet is holding a rocket launcher while the tribal priest totes a mini-gun.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY (V.O.)</strong><br />
Yes, Hardy Boys. Now I don't have to tell you what these guys are capable of. They ended up taking all my money, my gun, and quite possibly the largest gingerbread man ever killed in the wild.<br />
<br />

<em>Nina stares at Nancy.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY (CONT'D)</strong><br />
I have to talk to the Guinness people... about that.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina continues to stare.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Where's our money?<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
I spent it all on candy necklaces.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina sighs and pulls out a silenced pistol.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Woah, woah. Let's not rush into anything. I might not have the money, but maybe I can give you something to hold on to until I get it.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Like what?<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Whatever you want.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina looks around at the bunker.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
You know, I've never gotten the chance to tell you what a nice home and family you have here.<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy looks at Nina. Music swells.</em><br />

<em>Reveal of Cindy eavesdropping around a corner.</em><br />
