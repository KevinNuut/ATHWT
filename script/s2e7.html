<em><strong>STREETS OUTSIDE OF BUNKER</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Nancy and Charles exit the bunker and turn around to face the entrance.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Come on honey. We’re upstairs waiting. <br />
<br />
<em>Cindy runs to the bottom of the stairs.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CINDY</strong> <br />
But Dad, I don’t wanna go. <br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong>Sweetie, you know we have to get to the circus before the bear gets too drunk to do acrobatic high dives into the river.<br />
<strong> CINDY</strong> <br />
But I hate the circus. I always get mistaken for one of elephants. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
But you love when they feed you the peanuts. <br />
<br />
<strong> CINDY</strong> <br />
You’re right, I do. But do they have to cattle prod me? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
To be honest hon, you do get a little out of control when you get a few turkey crusted funnel cakes with extra cotton candy in you.<strong>CINDY</strong>Daaaddd.<em>(beat)</em>Mmmm. Turkey crusted funnel cake with extra cotton candy.<em>(beat)</em>Alright I’ll go. <br />
<br />
<em>Cindy runs up the stairs. Nancy is staring at the sky, oblivious of the conversation.</em><strong>NANCY</strong> <br />
Wait, we’re going to the circus I thought we were going to the gas station for more candy necklaces. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Don’t worry, we’ll go after the circus. <br />
<br />
<strong> NANCY</strong> <br />
Aaafffter! Then I’ll just get Sam to take me. Where is he? <br />
<br />
<em>Nancy looks around.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Remember your little problem… with the Chavez family… massive amounts of debt? <br />
<br />
<em>Nancy stares at him.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Remember giving away part of our house and selling our son into slavery? <br />
<br />
<em>Nancy stares at him.</em> <strong> NANCY</strong>Actually… ummm… now that I think about it… ummm… well… wait who’s Sam?<strong>CHARLES</strong>You know what, let’s just go to the circus. I just need to go one night without having to think about that scum Wellington. <br />
<strong> CINDY</strong>What do you mean? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong>If I could just figure out a way to get all the money Wellington owes us and at the same time, humiliate him in front of the whole town.<br />
<br />
<em>A rustle is heard and a slight movement is seen in the shadows. Charles turns slightly toward the noise.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Uh, Cindy why don’t you take Mom and head along to the circus? <br />
<br />
<strong> CINDY</strong> <br />
Aren’t you coming, Dad? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Yeah, but I forgot to plug my thing… into my other thing… before that thing does… something. <br />
<br />
<strong> CINDY</strong> <br />
Oh, ok. Come on, Mom. <br />
<br />
<em>Cindy and Nancy leave. Charles turns back toward shadowed figure. Maria walks out of the shadows.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> MARIA</strong> <br />
Do you know who I am? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Yeah, I know who you are, Chavez. <br />
<strong> MARIA</strong>Then you know that we share acommon enemy.<br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
Wellington. <br />
<br />
<strong> MARIA</strong> <br />
That blow hard has caused me nothing but pain from day one,&nbsp; and I hear he doesn’t do you any favors. <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
You got that right. <br />
<br />
<strong> MARIA</strong> <br />
What would you say if I told you I had a plan to make both your wishes come true? <br />
<br />
<strong> CHARLES</strong> <br />
I’d say…I’m listening. <br />
<br />
<em><strong> FADE TRANSITION TO WATER FRONT</strong></em> <br />
<br />
<em>See water.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> VOICE</strong> <br />
Don’t do it bear! You’re too drunk! <br />
<br />
<em>Bear roar. Bottle smashes. Bear walks to edge and falls into water. Drowns.</em>
