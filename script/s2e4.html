<em><strong>INTERIOR CHAVEZ COMPOUND BASEMENT</strong></em><br />

<em>Johnny stands in front of Rafe and Julie talking to them.</em><strong>JOHNNY</strong> <br />
And that was the third time a quarter got stuck in my nose. But it wouldn’t be the last. <br />
<br />
<em>Julie and Rafe look at each other and look back at Johnny. Roberto enters the room and walks up beside his brother. Johnny turns to Roberto, who still has a harpoon in his head.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
So how did it go with mom? <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto turns and looks at Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
What’d she say? <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto continues to stare at Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Was she happy? <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto still stares at Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
I bet she’ll make us my favorite cake. <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns to Julie and Rafe.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
<em> (very excited)</em> <br />
It’s called Melvin the Cephalopod. It’s an eighteen layer ice cream cake with marshmallow suckers and oatmeal creme pies for eyes. <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns back to Roberto.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
Do you think Mom will make us Melvin for doing such a good job? Do you? Huh? Huh? <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto stares at Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
Johnny, have you looked at my head? <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny looks at Roberto’s head.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Hey why do you have an arrow pointing out of your head? <br />
<em> (beat)</em> <br />
Oh, is it pointing in the direction of the cake? <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns in the direction the harpoon is pointing.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
No, you moron! Mom was really mad when I told her what YOU did and she shot me with her harpoon gun. <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Really? Where did she shoot you? <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto stares at Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
Did you really just ask that question? <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny stares at Roberto and looks him up and down until he focuses on the harpoon.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Ooohhh. She shot you in the head didn’t she? <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
There are those deductive powers I’ve heard so much about. Luckily it went through the same spot that she shot me in when you decided to make snow angels with all that white stuff in Mom’s super secret off limits work room. <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Ooo that was fun. <br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong> <br />
Focus. Now Mom told me that in order to fix this whole mess that you got us into, I need to go find Nina and she’ll tell us what to do. <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE (O.C.)</strong> <br />
I thought you were the one that came up with the plan to kidnap us. <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto and Johnny turn to look at Julie and Rafe.</em> <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe turns to look at Julie who is oblivious.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JULIE (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
I could have sworn it was you. Roberto, right? Cause Johnny was telling us that he could never come up with a plan this good. That’s why he always listens to you. <br />
<br />
<em>Rafe turns back to look at Roberto and Johnny.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Hey, yeah. I did say that, didn’t I? <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
<em> (to Julie)</em> <br />
You shut up. <br />
<em> (to Johnny)</em> <br />
You, over here. <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto walks a few feet away. Johnny joins him.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
What are you doing? <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Roberto, I think I did say that. Does that mean Mom didn’t like your idea? <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
Listen to how crazy you sound. Of course Mom would have like it if it had been my idea. <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
That’s what I thought. But she said- <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
There’s your problem right there. You’re listening to a Wellington. She’s getting inside your head. <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Those Wellingtons! <br />
<br />
<strong> ROBERTO</strong> <br />
And knowing your head, she’s probably got a whole living room set and a huge flat screen TV in there too. Anyway, I’m going to go find Nina so she can straighten your mess out. You stay here and don’t listen to a word those liars tell you. No matter how much sense it makes. <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
You can count on me bro. <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto leaves. Johnny goes back in front of Rafe and Julie. He stares them down.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY (CONT’D)</strong> <br />
And don’t even think about trying any of your mind tricks on me this time. <br />
<br />
<strong> RAFE</strong> <br />
Excuse me, Johnny, but I think you might be standing a little too close to that torch. <br />
<br />
<em>Johnny is engulfed in flames from head to toe.</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
I said don’t even think about it! I’m on to you! <br />
<br />
<em>Fade to black. After credits:</em> <br />
<br />
<strong> JOHNNY</strong> <br />
Something smells like burning.
