<em>Roberto holds a pistol pointed at the knocked out couple on the floor.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie and Rafe stand up in the basement of the Chavez compound.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Johnny stands up.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Ooo, I love your eggs. You get them so fluffy and soft.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Don't start.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto turns to leave the room.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Where are you going?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
To tell Mom about MY kidnapping.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
But I wanted to do that.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
But it was MY idea.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
I know but you know I have a better way with... umm...<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Words?<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
No.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Groups of syllables conveying your thoughts into a spoken language?<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Words?<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Yes. Words.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
When YOU have an idea, then I will be more than happy to let YOU tell Mom about it, but until that fateful day...<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Alright.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto leaves the room.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Johnny turns to Julie and Rafe. Roberto comes back in.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
And make sure they don't get away.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Who?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
I'm-<br />
<em>(to Julie and Rafe)</em><br />
Don't leave or I'll hunt you down and beat you with his thick skull.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto leaves again.<br />
<br />
Awkward silence.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Who's ready to take on the Candyland champion?!<br />
<br />
<em>Rafe and Julie look at each other.</em><br />
