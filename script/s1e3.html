<em><strong>INTERIOR CHAVEZ COMPOUND BASEMENT</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>MARIA, the mother and leader of the Chavez family, stands in the basement of her elaborate compound. She is a muscular red head with a large metal arm. She's cold blooded and only has a weak spot for money and her retarded sons, Roberto and Johnny.<br />
<br />
Maria aims a harpoon gun to an unseen area. She fires three shots.</em><br />
<em><br />
NINA enters from behind Maria. Nina is Maria's assistant and serves as the strong arm of the Chavez drug cartel. She is a blond girl with a welder's shield pulled up on top of her head. </em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
You're getting pretty good with that thing.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Is everything going to plan?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Yes, Ms. Chavez.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Excellent.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
That moron, Wellington, won't know what hit him.<br />
<br />
<em>Maria fires some shots and turns to Nina.</em><br />
<strong><br />
MARIA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
My husband may have been a well respected member of the community, but what he lacked was vision... Initiative. <br />
<br />
<em>Maria fires another shot.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
And testicles. But that was mostly my doing.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Well mostly the badger's doing. But I bought it...and fed it.<br />
<br />
<em>Maria laughs sadistically for an awkward amount of time. She slowly stops.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Was that too evil?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
No. No. It was fine.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Are you sure? Cause it felt a little...over the top.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
The laugh might have been a bit much.<br />
<br />
<em>Maria looks away from Nina and fires two more shots. She looks back and Nina.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
But that's just one person's opinion. Not mine, but one... person's.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Uh huh.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
How have the local sales been going?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Pretty good.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Except for-<br />
<br />
<em>Maria stops firing and looks at Nina.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
What?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
That robot in Bunker 62 still owes us. Big.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
How big?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Small nation fighting for its independence against a ruthless warlord hell bent on world domination size.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Take care of that. Personally.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina nods, turns, and walks out. Maria fires two more shots.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Now, are you gonna try to steal my newspaper again?<br />
<br />
<em>A MAN with dozens of harpoons stuck into his body. His voice trembles.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MAN</strong><br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
I'm glad we could have this talk. You can go now.<br />
<br />
<em>The Man walks past Maria.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA (CONT'D)</strong><br />
And tell your wife I want to talk to her about her rose garden.<br />
<br />
<em>The Man nods and runs out. Maria stares into the distance.</em><br />
