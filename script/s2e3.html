<em><strong>EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE OF ROBOT BUNKER</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington and Butler walk together down the road to the bunker's entrance.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
I don't think it is humanly possible to hate you more than I do right now.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Did I, or did I not tell you that I wanted to ride those bumper cars?<br />
<em>The two of them stop in front of the entrance to the bunker.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, you did sir. But-<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
But nothing, son. You've got some nerve even speaking to me after disobeying a direct order from your boss.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Sir, that carnival was shutdown 5 years ago.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
I provide for you, don't I?<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
You bet your sweet ass I do. And where do you think that money I don't pay you comes from.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Sir?<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Work, boy. Work. Every red cent I make, I earn.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Yes, sir.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Do you know how hard it is for me to go all the way down to the mailbox everyday, take the check addressed to me out of it, have you drive me down to the bank or liquor store, if I get up late, and have them cash it?<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
I would imagine it is very hard, sir.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Shut your sasshole.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina exits the bunker directly into Wellington and Butler's conversation. They both turn to look at her.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON (CONT'D)</strong><br />
I thought I made myself quite clear, Nina. The Chavez family is not welcome in this town.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Truthfully Wellington, Mrs. Chavez doesn't care what a brain dead fool who can't grow a proper mustache thinks.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
I won't stand here and let you say an unkind word about my butler without me introducing him to you.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Hello. My name is-<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington turns and punches Butler.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Shut up. No one is talking to you.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Frankly Wellington, you don't have a clue about what is going on in this town.<br />
<br />
<em>Mr. Wellington becomes irate and punches Butler twice.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Yes, I do! I know the candy store owner gives out lollipops to babies or men pretending to be babies. I know the town puts formaldehyde in the drinking water for population control. And I know of a little motel off the interstate where they won't ask any questions when a young blond girl and a suave older man checked in for 15 minutes of growling at the badger.<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
Oooo juicy!<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Don't start.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Making some baskets.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Stop it.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Crashing the custard truck.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
What?<br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
I believe he's referring to sex.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina and Wellington turn and punch Butler. Nina turns back to Wellington.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
I thought I told you to never bring that up.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
How am just supposed to forget our time together?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
You're making it sound like I was the one who chose to endâ€¦whatever it was we had.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
You can't be saying that I put end to us?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Of course I am. After THAT incident, you ran off to Thailand and came back with that little trophy.<br />
<br />
<strong>MR. WELLINGTON</strong><br />
Watch what you say Nina.<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
At least I can talk.<br />
<br />
<em>Wellington stares at Nina. Nina stares back.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
What is she referring to sir?<br />
<br />
<em>Wellington punches Butler. Wellington turns back to Nina, no longer in a pleasant mood.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>WELLINGTON</strong><br />
<em> (growls to Nina)</em><br />
Get out of my town.<br />
<br />
<em>Nina turns takes two steps and turns back around.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Of course some people would say that this is no longer YOUR town.<br />
<br />
<strong>WELLINGTON</strong><br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
Well if it really was your town, how could the Chavez family own half of the bunker directly under your feet.<br />
<br />
<strong>WELLINGTON</strong><br />
What are you talking about!?<br />
<br />
<em>Nina LAUGHS and walks off.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>NINA</strong><br />
<em>(over her shoulder)</em><br />
Ask your sister-in-law, Nancy.<br />
<br />
<em>Wellington and Butler are left standing alone.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>BUTLER</strong><br />
What is she referring to sir?<br />
<br />
<em>Wellington punches Butler.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>WELLINGTON</strong><br />
I need to find out what's going on here.<br />
<br />
<em>Wellington heads into the bunker with Butler behind him.</em>
