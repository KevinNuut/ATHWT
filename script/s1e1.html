<em><strong>INTERIOR SUBWAY</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>A young, attractive, blond girl, JULIE, stands on the subway platform waiting for a train.</em><em>She wears a slutty white dress and has a piece of cloth over her mouth and nose like she belongs in Dune. Julie paces back and forth. <br />
<br />
A train sounds in the distance. Julie looks in it's direction with hope. The train shoots past her in a rush, not even slowing down.<br />
<br />
Julie sighs. A sleazy looking MAN has appeared behind Julie after the passing of the train. He wears a blue leisure suit and sports a cheesy porn star mustache. <br />
<br />
The Man sneaks up behind Julie.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MAN</strong><br />
Surprise!<br />
<br />
<em>Julie screams and beats the holy hell out of him.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Help!<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Please don't hurt me!<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
I'll give you whatever you want, just don't hurt me!<br />
<br />
<em>The Man falls into a ball on the pavement.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Julie stops her beating.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Rafe, is that you?<br />
<br />
<em>RAFE sniffles.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Baby, you scared me. Why were you dressed like that?<br />
<br />
<em>As Rafe stands up, his image changes from the mustache man into a hideous blue alien. He has two bulging eyes on each side of his head, like a fish. His "mouth" only consists of a top jaw that appears to be always pointed up like he's screaming.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
I just thought your Dad wouldn't approve of you marrying outside of your...species.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
He's never complained before.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
What's that?<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Nothing. Sweetie, Daddy's going to love you.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
I'm just worried that things could get ugly. I went through it all in high school. All the purple nurples and bra snapping. <br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
And the name calling. Jaws. Lobster Eyes. <br />
<br />
<em>Julie starts laughing hysterically.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Lobster Eyes! I never noticed that before. Oh my God-<br />
<br />
<em>Rafe stares at her.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE (CONT'D)</strong><br />
That's not even funny. Kids can be so cruel. But don't worry, Daddy's the most loving and caring man I know.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
And I spent time in Bangkok.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
What's that?<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Nothing.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO (O.C.)</strong><br />
Stop it, Johnny.<br />
<br />
<em>ROBERTO runs onto the platform with JOHNNY following him. Roberto and Johnny are identical twins. By looking at them, you can't tell them apart. But after you hear them speak, you know that Roberto is the brains of the operation, but the operation is not doing too well. Johnny repeatedly fires a handgun at Roberto's feet.<br />
<br />
Johnny giggles after each shot as he chases Roberto up and down the platform.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO (CONT'D)</strong><br />
I'm serious, Johnny.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto stops running and turns around to face Johnny. They just happen to stop directly next to Rafe and Julie.<br />
<br />
Johnny takes two more shots at Roberto's feet.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO (CONT'D)</strong><br />
What'd I just say?<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto draws his own handgun and points it at Johnny's head. Johnny stops laughing and points his gun at Roberto's head. Tense moment.<br />
<br />
Julie turns to Rafe.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Here's hoping they both wet themselves when the bullets lodge in their brains.<br />
<br />
<em>Rafe looks at Julie and then back to Roberto and Johnny. Roberto has turned to look at Julie, as well.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Uh...honey.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Daddy was just saying the other day that the Chavez family is like a fungus that gets in between your toes and starts to smell -<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Honey.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
But then you try to put medicine on it, but the medicine smells even worse than the fungus.<br />
<br />
<strong>RAFE</strong><br />
Sweetie.<br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
At that point, you might as well cut your foot off and be done with it.<br />
<br />
<em>Uncomfortable silence as Roberto stares at Rafe and Julie.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Isn't that a neat analogy?<br />
<br />
<em>Johnny is still pointing his gun at Roberto's head.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
What the...who do you think you are?<br />
<br />
<em>Julie gives a Napoleon sigh, belabored to have to answer a Chavez.</em><br />
<strong><br />
JULIE</strong><br />
Julie Wellington. Or as you may know me, your social better.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Look here you little -<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Ahem! Mexican standoff here!<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Later. Later.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Why is it that everytime you want to have a Mexican standoff we have to do it, but when I want to do one you always shrug me off?<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto turns to Johnny.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Shut up.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
No, no. I want to talk about this. <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto stares at him.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY (CONT'D)</strong><br />
I'm telling Mom.<br />
<br />
<em>Julie turns to Rafe.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JULIE</strong><br />
Let's go.<br />
<br />
<em>Rafe nods and follows Julie out of the subway.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
See that's your problem right there. Everything that doesn't go your way, you tell Mom.<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
Well she has the right to know.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Know what? That you're a wuss.<br />
<br />
<em>Johnny drops his head, knowing he's been beaten. Roberto turns to stare in the direction Rafe and Julie exited. Evil music builds in the background.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO (CONT'D)</strong><br />
We've got to teach that stuck-up Wellington brat that no one insults the Chavez family and gets away with it.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
But how?<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
I've got it! <br />
<br />
<em>Roberto turns to Johnny.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Let's go to Pizzapotamus for lunch.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
How is that going to teach her a lesson?<br />
<br />
<strong>JOHNNY</strong><br />
<em>(slowly)</em><br />
We won't invite her.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Or let her have any of our leftovers.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
I hate you. Come on.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto exits with Johnny in tow.</em><br />
