<em><strong>INSIDE CHAVEZ COMPOUND COURTYARD</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Maria stands in the open courtyard of the Chavez Compound. Roberto enters the courtyard.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Hey, Mom. I've been looking all over for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Where have you been?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Mom, I got something real special for you. Guess what it is?<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Well it's too late for an abortion so what else could it be?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
You have to guess?<br />
<strong><br />
MARIA<br />
</strong>I don't know, you and your brother have been declared legally retarded and I'm going to get money from the government to take care of you.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Good one, Mom, but seriously guess what?<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
You got rid of that idiot, Wellington for me?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Hey, close. Guess who Johnny and I kidnapped today?<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
There is no good answer to that question.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Julie Wellington and some fish-man-thing.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
What!?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Well, he might be part squid, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
No, you condom advertisement! Why would you even think about kidnapping anyone even remotely related to Wellington!? Do you understand the hellfire he has the ability to bring down on this family!? And why am I just hearing about this now!?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Let me explain. Let me explain. Johnny was having one of his night terrors and I thought I better wake him before he wets the bed again.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Uh huh.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Then Johnny couldn't fall back asleep, so we decided to go down to the subway platform because you know how flattening pennies relaxes him.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Right.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
So we run into Wellington's brat daughter and she is going on about how much better they are than us and I just couldn't take it anymore. We knocked them out and grabbed them right outside of Wellington's place.<br />
<br />
<em>Maria reloads her harpoon gun.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
I repeat, why am I just hearing about this now?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Well, we were on are way right back here, when we saw a civil war re-enactment and you know how Johnny loves his muskets, so we had to stop. By the time that was done, it was lunch time, so we headed over to Medieval Times for an authentic King Arthur food experience.<br />
<br />
<em>Maria aims the weapon at Roberto's head.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
You want to taste one of these don't you?<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
<em>(speeds up)</em><br />
Then Johnny wanted some ice cream and we went to like six ice cream trucks before we could find the Mickey Mouse bar with gumball eyes. But when he was eating it, he got some on his shirt so we went to the dry cleaners but Johnny wouldn't take his shirt off because he didn't want anyone to see his “innie” nipples. So we walk out of the dry cleaners and this pack of dogs starts chasing us because of the chocolate on Johnny's shirt and probably the turkey legs we had taken from Medieval Times. We finally lost them and remembered we had left Wellington's daughter and fish man in the trunk of car, so we got back to the car and came right here.<br />
<br />
<em>A harpoon goes through Roberto's head.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO (CONT'D)</strong><br />
Owww.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Shut up. Find Nina. We need damage control on this mess. Now.<br />
<br />
<strong>ROBERTO</strong><br />
Owww.<br />
<br />
<strong>MARIA</strong><br />
Stop crying. Go.<br />
<br />
<em>Roberto exits the room.</em><br />
