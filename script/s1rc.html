<strong>HAMSTER (NARRATE)</strong><br />
</strong>The town in As the Hamster Wheel Turns is split up into three
conflicting families, the Wellingtons, the Chavez's, and the Robots.<br />
<br />
The Wellingtons are made up of...<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington a mustachioed business tycoon whom inherited his super fortune from his father, creator of the robot race. He is in a continual struggle with the Chavez family for control of the town and with the Robot family for control of his finances.<br />
<br />
Julie Wellington who is a spoiled rich girl who thinks the world revolves around her...and in her father's eyes, it does. Recently, she has met the man of her dreams, in Rafe, and plans to marry him...with her father's approval, of course.<br />
<br />
Following Mr. Wellington's first wife's tragic accident, he took Ginger as his trophy wife. He met Ginger in a cockfighting arena in Thailand and instantly fell in love with the fact that she has some of the largest breasts in existence and she is a mute.<br />
<br />
Rafe met Julie in college and began dating her. After a time, or a few times anyway, they fell in love and decided to get married. Rafe is a very normal guy with the exceptions of being a vegan and an alien of some kind.<br />
<br />
Mr. Wellington's Butler has a thankless job. He waits on Mr. Wellington, hand and foot and beckons to his every insane request and order. However, Butler may be more than meets the eye...<br />

<strong>HAMSTER (NARRATE)</strong><br />
The Chavez family is made up of...<br />
<br />
Maria who is the mother and head of the Chavez drug cartel. Following the death of her husband, in a very unfortunate badger accident, which she had nothing to do with, Maria seized control of most of the drug operations in the county. She is constantly looking for ways to rid herself of Mr. Wellington and take complete control of the town.<br />
<br />
Nina who is Maria's right hand woman and enforcer of the Chavez drug cartel. She is responsible for all collections and expansions of the business and takes her role very seriously. She is also responsible for looking out for Maria's two moron sons, Roberto and Johnny.<br />
<br />
Roberto who is the slightly smarter of Maria's twin sons. He is constantly trying to make his mom happy by doing what he thinks she would want, but all he ends up doing is messing things up even worse.<br />
<br />
And Johnny who is the incredibly dumber of Maria's twin sons. He is constantly trying to stay focused on Roberto's plans with so many shiny things around. He loves to eat at Pizzapotamus and play skee-ball.<br />

The Robots are made up of...<br />
<br />
Charles who is the father of the Robot family and was one of the first robots designed by Mr. Wellington's father. Because of this, he feels his family is entitled to his share of the Wellington fortune.<br />
<br />
Nancy who is the mother of the Robot family and is horribly addicted to drugs. This addiction has complete control of her and could end up destroying the entire Robot family.<br />
<br />
Cindy who is the daughter of the Robot family and has the typical problems a teenage girl has at that age, she weighs half a ton. Cindy is constantly fighting with her brother, Sam, and could easily be pushed into some of the darker areas of the family.<br />
<br />
And Sam who is the son of the Robot family and is a smart ass following in his father's foot steps of hating the Wellingtons. Sam loves to tease Cindy about her weight or anything else he can think of.<br />

<strong>HAMSTER (NARRATE)</strong><br />
In season one, Rafe comes to visit Julie, to ask her father for her hand in marriage. Julie unmistakably insults Roberto, Johnny, and the whole Chavez family. Charles hurls bricks through Mr. Wellington’s windows for the money he feels he’s owed. Meanwhile, Maria tells Nina to get the money owed to her from Nancy Robot. At the Robot household, Cindy has a hard time dealing with the fact that she is fat. Nancy suggests drug use as a way to combat this issue. When Rafe finally meets Mr. Wellington, everyone is shocked to find out that Rafe is a vegan. Mr. Wellington throws Rafe and Julie out. On their way out, Johnny and Roberto surprise them and kidnap them both. Meanwhile, Nina confronts Nancy about her lack of payment for the drugs she’s been using. Johnny and Roberto hold Julie and Rafe in their basement and plan to tell their mother about what they have done. Sigh.<br />
