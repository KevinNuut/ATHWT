<em><strong>INTERIOR BUNKER MAIN ROOM</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em>Charles stands in the main room of the bunker looking up at the charts on the wall.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Cindy enters the room and stands behind Charles.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Dad?<br />
<br />
<em>Charles keeps looking at the charts on the wall.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Yes, honey.<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
What’s an eight ball?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
It’s the black ball on a pool table.<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Oh.<br />
<em>(beat)</em><br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles continues staring at the charts on the wall. Cindy does not move from her spot.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY (CONT’D)</strong><br />
Dad?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Yeah, cupcake.<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
What does “white meat” mean?<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
It’s a type of chicken, honey.<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Oh.<br />
<em> (beat)</em><br />
Then why would some one cut chicken if they didn’t get the money for the pool balls?<br />
<br />
<em>Charles turns around.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
What are you talking about?<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Well I was upstairs and some guys were moving all this chemistry stuff into the rumpus room.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
What?<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
And I heard this guy tell this other guy that if he didn’t get the money for the eightballs he would cut him to the white meat.<br />
<br />
<em>Charles whips toward the door.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Nancy! Get in here!<br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
I’m going to go get some of that chicken from that guy.<br />
<br />
<em>Nancy enters the room. Charles turns to Cindy.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Leave them alone and go get your brother for dinner.<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy leaves as Nancy joins the conversation.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Nancy, why are there men upstairs making and selling drugs?<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
They told me they were avant-garde Lego artists who needed a space to to express their bold and controversial designs.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Nancy!<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
I gave half the house to the Chavez family.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
You did what?!<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
I had to. I owed so much money to them. They threatened my life.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
You gave them <em>our</em> house?<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Only half. We still have somewhere to live. As long as we don’t go upstairs. That’s considered off limits now. And don’t even try to steal any drugs unless you like box cutters to the eye.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
I can’t believe you did this to us.<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Personally, I don’t like box cutters… but I do like the drugs.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
Focus, Nancy! So you don’t owe them anything else? This is it, right?<br />
<br />
<strong>NANCY</strong><br />
Well…not exactly. Half of the house was half of the debt.<br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
What was the other half?<br />
<br />
<em>Cindy re-enters the room.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CINDY</strong><br />
Dad, I can’t find Sam anywhere. Can I have his dinner?<br />
<br />
<em>Charles turns from Cindy to Nancy.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>CHARLES</strong><br />
What did you do?<br />
