The show is written and staged like your every day soap opera, with the characters being broken up into three families.
Each family has their own set of problems, however, their paths are forced to meet when money, greed, land, and drugs
become involved.<br /><br />

<strong class='mainTitle'>The Wellington Family</strong><br /><br />
      
      <strong>Mr. Wellington</strong><br />
      Mr. Wellington inherited his super fortune from his father, who created the robot race.  He is in a continual struggle with the Chavez family for control of the town and with the Robot family for control of his finances. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Julie Wellington</strong><br />

      <br /><br />
      <strong>Ginger</strong><br />
      Following Mr. Wellington's first wife's tragic accident, he took Ginger as his trophy wife.  He met Ginger in a cockfighting arena in Thailand and instantly fell in love with the fact that she has some of the largest breasts in existence and she is a mute. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Rafe</strong><br />
      Rafe met Julie in college and began dating her.  After a time, or a few times anyway, they fell in love and decided to get married.  Rafe is a very normal guy with the exceptions of being a vegan and an alien of some kind. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Butler</strong><br />
      Mr. Wellington's Butler has a thankless job.  He waits on Mr. Wellington, hand and foot and beckons to his every insane request and order.  However, Butler may be more than meets the eye...and that isn't a Transformer joke. 
<br /><br />

      <strong>Charles Robot</strong><br />

      <strong>Cindy Robot</strong><br />
      Cindy is the daughter of the Robot family and has the typical problems a teenage girl has at that age, she weighs half a ton.  Cindy is constantly fighting with her brother, Sam, and could easily be pushed into some of the darker areas of the family. 
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Sam Robot</strong><br />
