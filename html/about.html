<div style="text-align: justify;">
As the Hamster Wheel Turns is a comedic soap opera machinima created using Timesplitters: Future Perfect on the Microsoft Xbox.  
AtHWT focuses on three families, the Wellingtons, the Chavez, and the Robots, trying to get along while living in the same town.  
AtHWT came about through our love of video games, over the top comedies, and soap operas.  The main influence on the creation of 
the show is the classic TV show, Soap.  We felt that this kind of story had not been done through machinima and decided Timesplitters: 
Future Perfect was the perfect game to use due to its unique characters and locations.  
We are currently planning out the future of the show, so stay tuned.
