<strong>What game is that?</strong><br />
<br />
Timesplitters: Future Perfect for the Microsoft Xbox <br />
<br />
<strong>How do you record your audio?</strong><br />
<br />
All voices are recorded with a Lexicon Lambda digital USB recording device, an MXR condensor microphone, and Cubase SX 3 recording software.  To avoid pops, we use a pop filter in front of the microphone.  Peaks are regulated by monitoring the Lambda.  Effects are then added to the voices to give them a full sound.  License free music is then added over the audio for key dramatic moments. <br />
<br />
<strong>How do you get a free camera in Timesplitters: Future Perfect?</strong><br />
<br />
There is no free camera in Timesplitters: Future Perfect.  What you are seeing in the episodes is the normal first person view with the round rank and character arm blocked out by the widescreen bars. <br />
<br />
<strong>How do you film your videos?</strong><br />
<br />
We use to Xboxes connected through a system link.  One system only has one controller attached to it and is the camera system.  The other system can have up to four controllers attached to it and it is the actor system.  The camera system's audio and video cables are attached directly to a DV camera through an S-video connection.  In order to ensure our head nods sync up with the audio, we play the audio while recording the shots to the camera.  We then capture the footage and edit everything in Final Cut Express. <br />
<br />
<strong>Why don't you use Halo?</strong><br />
<br />
We felt that while Halo 3 has a great machinima creating tool in its Theater Mode, we wanted to use a game that doesn't get enough love.  With Timesplitters, we have access to so many unique characters for a soap opera, it is a perfect fit. <br />
<br />
<strong>But have you played Halo?</strong><br />
<br />
Yeah, we've played and aren't really fans of it.  Seth is a Socom fan, Kevin is a diehard Diablo guy, and Jesse lives for Mega Man. <br />
<br />
<strong>Why haven't you used <put Timesplitters character name here> in your show?</strong><br />
<br />
We typically only use characters whose mouths are covered so when they speak, you can believe it more.  We are planning on branching out the characters we use so look out for future episodes to possibly feature your favorite characters. <br />
<br />
<strong>Are you going to use Timesplitters 4?</strong><br />
<br />
Timesplitters 4 is so early in development right now, we have no idea whether it will have everything we need in order to use it for the show.  We would love to transition the story to Timesplitters 4 but right now we just have to wait and see what the game is going to be like.
